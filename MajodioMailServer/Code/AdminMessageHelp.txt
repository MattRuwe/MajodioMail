               ** Majodio Mail Email Administration Help **
               ********************************************

Thank you for using Majodio Mail.  The email administation system is a very 
powerful feature.  Please find a detailed description of how to use the 
system below.


Remarks:  
    All commands have the implied parameter AdminPassword which contains
    the password used to issue commands and is case sensitive.  This 
    password is set in the Majodio Mail User Interface.

    The MIME content-type of the message should be text/plain.  To
    configure your e-mail application to send text/plain messages refer
    to any help provided by the manufacturer.  When the command email is
    first received, the MIME message is searched for a content-type of
    TEXT/PLAIN.  If no body parts are found with this content-type, the 
    email will be rejected.

    Once the command has been processed, the mail server will send a 
    message back to the sender account to inform the sender if the 
    command was successful or failed.  If the command failed, the message 
    will contain details of why the failure occurred.
       
Command Syntax:  
    <Command Name>:<Command Value>
        
    Example:
        AdminPassword:Password
    Remarks:         
        Spaces before and after the command value are ignored.
